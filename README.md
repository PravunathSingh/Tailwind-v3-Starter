## TailwindCSS v3 CSS Starter Template (HTML)

With Version 3, TailwindCSS has gone a major upgrade and now JIT mode comes default with it.
Since Tailwind no longer uses PurgeCSS under the hood, they've renamed the "purge" option to "content" to better reflect what itâ€™s for:

```
module.exports = {
  - purge: [
  + content: [
    // Example content paths...

    './public/**/*.html',
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue}',
  ],
  theme: {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The remaining changes in tailwindCSS can be looked up in the documentation on their official website.
